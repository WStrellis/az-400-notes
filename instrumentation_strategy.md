# Logging

Apps running on Windows runtime can write logs either to the filesystem of their container or to Blob Storage. Apps running in Linux containers can only write logs to the docker filesystem.  

When file system logging is enabled it will only save logs for 12h(default) to prevent negative impacts on app performance.  

*Log File Locations*
- Windows - D:\LogFiles
    - Application/ - logs generated by the app if File System logging is enabled
    - DetailedErrors/ - Server logs if `Detailed` error messages are enabled
    - http/ - IIS-level logs if `Web Server logging` has been enabled
    - W3SVC<number>/ - details of failed http requests if `Failed Requests` has been enabled
- Blob Container - logs are stored in year, month, day , and hour folders
- Linux - logs are stored in underlying docker container that runs the app
